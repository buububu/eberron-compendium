    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Elves in Eberron are a diverse people whose societies reflect ancient traditions, religious reverence, and martial prowess. From the necromantic reverence of the Aereni to the ancestral valor of the Valenar and the elemental mysticism of the Drow, elves have evolved beyond a single cultural identity.</p>

    <h3>Physical Traits</h3>
    <p>All elves are lithe, graceful, and long-lived â€” often reaching ages of 750 years. They have sharp features, pointed ears, and carry themselves with a natural poise that many races find otherworldly.</p>

    <h3>Culture and Society</h3>
    <p>Elf culture varies drastically between subraces. The Aereni are scholars and preservers of ancient tradition. The Valenar live as warrior-nomads emulating epic heroes. The Drow in Xen'drik walk spiritual paths, worshipping primal forces or ancient powers.</p>
