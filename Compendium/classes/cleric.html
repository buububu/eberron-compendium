    <h1>Cleric <img src="../images/symbols/class/cleric.png" alt="Cleric Symbol" class="class-symbol"></h1>
    <p><em>"A voice of the divine, a shield of faith, a channel of miracles. Clerics wield the power of belief in service to gods, causes, and forces beyond mortal ken."</em></p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In Eberron, faith is as diverse as the lands themselves. Clerics are not simply priests or missionaries—they are conduits of belief, shaped by divine tradition or spiritual force. They might lead congregations, wield radiant power against evil, or act as lone prophets guided by unseen visions.</p>
    <p>Clerics are divine spellcasters who channel the will of gods or cosmic forces. In Eberron, this connection may be to the Sovereign Host, the Silver Flame, the Blood of Vol, or even abstract beliefs like the Becoming God or the Path of Light. Divine magic flows through faith, not necessarily favor; even agnostics can wield clerical power through devotion to an ideal.</p>

    <h3>Appearance and Equipment</h3>
    <p>Clerics vary widely in appearance, often reflecting their domain or deity. A cleric of Dol Arrah may wear burnished armor and sun emblems, while one of the Blood of Vol might carry ritual blades and wear crimson vestments. Common weapons include maces, warhammers, or sacred symbols, and armor varies by order—from robes to full plate.</p>

    <h3>Training and Origins</h3>
    <p>Becoming a cleric may begin with solemn oath, prophetic dream, or painful loss. Some train under abbots or war-chaplains, reciting catechisms and practicing healing rites. Others are self-taught zealots who found divine fire in the wilderness. In Eberron, belief alone is often the spark that unlocks divine magic.</p>
    <p>Clerics are not always born into priesthood. Some receive visions or feel a divine calling. Others train in monastic or temple traditions. In Thrane, clerics serve in the Church of the Silver Flame’s militant and healing orders. In Karrnath, followers of the Blood of Vol study necromantic rites and doctrines.</p>

    <h3>Culture and Role in Eberron</h3>
    <p>Clerics are not universally beloved, but their powers are respected. In cosmopolitan cities like Sharn, they might run shrines alongside artifice-driven temples. In war-torn regions, clerics act as both field medics and moral compass. A cleric of Onatar might forge enchanted armor, while one of the Traveler could be a trickster with a message. Beyond religion, clerics influence law, medicine, prophecy, and war.</p>
    <p>Clerics are respected figures in most Eberron societies, seen as spiritual advisors, healers, and protectors. Their influence is strongest where religion shapes governance—such as Thrane or Aerenal. In more secular nations like Breland, clerics are valued for practical spellcasting. Some act as inquisitors or divine agents, others as battlefield medics or diplomats guided by celestial wisdom.</p>
